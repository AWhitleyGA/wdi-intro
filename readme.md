### Icebreaker (20 minutes)

Wireframe your partner!

Find a partner. Spend 5 minutes sketching your partner. On the left, draw three things
he or she likes, and on the right, three things he or she dislikes.

Switch!

For the remaining 10 minutes, we’ll go around the room and share!

Here’s a wireframe of Adrian as an example:

### Growth Mindset (10 minutes)

[Growth Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_oqghnxBmY_) - [Dr. Carol Dweck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck)

- This may be the most mentally challenging thing you've ever done – the first time you've been bad at something in a long time.
- Failure and struggle are crucial aspects of this path. We don't succeed despite challenges -- we succeed because of challenges. [The Learning Myth: Why I'll Never Tell My Son He's Smart](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/blog/post/95208400815/the-learning-myth-why-ill-never-tell-my-son-hes)
  - Unfortunately, this can hurt. Just like exercise can make you sore and tired, so should learning. Try to enjoy the burn knowing it is making you better.
  - We as instructors anticipate that you will run into hardships. When you do, don't run for the hills! Buckle down and work through the problem. Embrace the fact that the hardship will make you a better coder. Endure the struggle to grow and develop your mind.
  - The Emotional Cycle of Change
  ![Emotional Cycle of Change](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/3c/f4/fa/3cf4faeb2078f4f4fbb9265444bde2e0.jpg)
- Just memorizing stuff won't help you. Learning HOW to code will.
  - ~~You can't BS your way through code.~~
  - The fundamental standard of programming: It either works, or it doesn't. No amount of sweet-talking will make it work.
  - Programming is a mindset. It's about confidence and being open to failure. It's about being able to say, "Eh, I'm going to try this thing, even though I don't really understand it. AND I'm not going to get attached to it in case it doesn't work and I have to erase all my code and try something completely different."
- So many students throughout my time here say, "I don't know how to do that." or some variation of that. Many of you will say it. Just add "...yet" to it.

### What is an immersive course? (5 minutes)

**Turn & Talk**: Let's take one minute to turn to our neighbors and discuss: "What's different about an immersive environment?"

- What does it mean to be in a "immersive course"?
  - You can't "win" -- and can't lose!
    - This is a noncompetitive environment.
    - You get out what you put in.
  - Cooperation
    - You'll be learning, eating, growing, failing, and succeeding TOGETHER for the next 12 weeks!
  - You may be re-learning how to learn.
    - The last time you spent 9 hours a day learning something new was in high school.
  - You will be uncomfortable.  Regularly.
    - Emotional Cycle of Change
    - Be empathetic.
    - You will probably feel somewhat lost on this week's topic, feel more comfortable with last week lessons, and notice that a few weeks ago looks easy.
  - Balance. This intensity means that we have to make room for balance.
    - Sleep, food, hydration, rest, and hygiene.
  - We will not give up on you
    - Even when you might have given up on yourself!
    - None of the instructors are here just to collect a paycheck. We're nerds, about web development, education, and you.
  - Trust that our decisions are informed by solid experience.
    - In industry
    - At GA
    - We rely on your feedback. At the same time, we ultimately have to trust in our own experience and expertise first.
  - Ultimately, we ask you to **trust us and each other.**
    - Trust that we have each other's best interests at heart.
    - But we expect to have to work to earn that trust.

Note that none of the above mention anything about code.

### What is asking for help? (5 minutes)

- This is the thing students find the hardest, and the thing that ultimately determines whether or not they will be successful in this class.
- Without fail, the students who do not ask for help do the poorest in the class.
- Most importantly, knowing how to ask for help and where to look for answers is one of the biggest skills you can gain from this class that will be applicable as you prepare to join the professional workforce.

Everyone should take 30 seconds to think of a time when they've asked someone
for help. It doesn't have to be tech-related. Take 30 seconds to turn and talk
with your tablemates about those times. What were the outcomes?

- We have all asked for help. There's no shame in it. Feeling afraid to ask for help will be the biggest detriment in this class.
- What makes asking for help effective?
  - Asking a clear problem. "I don't know any of this" isn't a clear problem. "I tried this thing and got this error" is a clear problem.
  - We'll ask you for help when:
      - The question you're asking isn't constructive
      - It's clear you haven't made an effort to find the answer
          - First, try it yourself
          - Then, Google it
          - Then, ask your neighbor
          - Finally, ask an instructor

### Course content (10 minutes)

#### How the Class is Built

GA's global team (including many of the instructors here) has built a baseline curriculum, which includes topics to cover, and a
suggested order. As a local campus, we have built on and modified this
curriculum based on own experiences as instructors, and the unique features
of the DC job market. Each lesson is designed by the instructor that's
delivering it.

We also iterate on this curriculum constantly, so technologies,  concepts, etc,
change with each cohort. Last cohort started with Ruby, but as JS becomes more
and more important, we've started teaching JS first, switching to Ruby, then
back to JS.

#### Course Content

Exercise: Ask students to list technologies / languages that they think are
involved in web development. Examples: HTML, Ruby, Databases, etc.

Map out the technologies and how they relate to each other. Lead a discussion
on which technologies we'll cover, why we chose those, and why we can't cover
everything.

Technologies we cover:

- HTML
- CSS / SASS
- JavaScript
- Ruby
- PostgreSQL (Relational Database)
- MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
- Rails
- Node.js / Express
- Angular.js

We cover these technologies / topics because they are foundational to web
development, and learning the underlying concepts of how they work prepares you
to learn and work in any web development technologies.

#### Course Sequence

This course has been pretty well-planned for all 12 weeks, but this is subject
to change.

The course is organized by units of roughly 1 week each. Every 3 weeks, we'll
complete a project (~3-5 days each).

Units/Projects:

- Front-end Fundamentals (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Intermediate Front-end (Intermediate JavaScript / jQuery)
- Project 1 - Build an application using HTML / CSS / JS
- Ruby / Data Persistance / Backend Dev w/ Sinatra
- Full-stack MVC w/ Rails
- Project 2 - Build a full-stack, data driven app w/ Rails
- Building APIs with Rails and Express
- Advanced Front-end (using API's on clientside)
- Project 3 - Build a backend API and Front-end that consumes it
- Front-End Frameworks
- Project 4 - Portfolio project

## Course Logistics (10 minutes)

This is an overview of the key points of course logistics. Please ask your squad instructor if you have any questions. It's really important that you understand all of this!

Also, note that everything I'm about to talk about is detailed in the `ga-dc/wdi8` repository on Github. I'm just highlighting some things here.

#### Project Weeks (3, 7, 9, 12)

Project weeks will be pretty much just time for you to work on your project.

- There will be no scheduled lessons, except for a few optional mini-lessons.
- There will be no evening office hours, since instructors will be widely available during the day.
- In most cases, the Outcomes schedule will also remain the same during project weeks

### Squads and Rotations

Squads will rotate classrooms after each project, so you will have the opportunity to work with everybody over the course of the 12 weeks.

We'll all have the same lessons and the same homework. To increase instructor availability, each class' lesson schedule may be offset by a day or two.

### Homework

There will be roughly 2 hours of homework every night. You'll be submitting the homework through Github, which we'll cover later on this week. All assignments will be due on Thursday at 9am. Your squad instructor will provide meaningful feedback on one of these assignments and also on your lab. Robin will check all the other homework and provide feedback and answer questions if you ask.

It's **really, really** important that you submit homework even if -- and maybe especially if -- you didn't complete it. We would much rather you spend 2 hours taking a stab at something and turn it in unfinished than you spend 10 hours and turn it in perfect.

This is because without seeing your homework, we have no idea how you're progressing with the material, and so we can't get you the help you may need. Also if you don't turn in anything then it suggests to us that you're not making WDI a priority, and as such we shouldn't make you a priority.

Assignments are graded on whether or not you seem to have made a meaningful effort to do them. There are three possible grades for each assignment:
  - Complete: meaningful effort was made. How "good" your code is doesn't have any impact on this.
  - Incomplete: something was turned in, but meaningful effort was not made. No changes were made to the assignment, and/or it was blatantly plagiarized.
  - Missing: nothing was turned in.

### Incentives

If you complete 80% of the homework assigned over the duration of the class, and have minimal absences and tardies, then you get the benefit of being "recommended for hire". This means:

- You may attend the Meet and Hire
- You may publish a Profile on profiles.generalassemb.ly
- The instructors and staff will be happy to write job recommendations for you
- The Outcomes team will prioritize helping you in your job search

We expect each of you to meet to these standards.

If you fall below these standards, then you won't be considered "recommended for hire", and won't get these incentives. You can still attend class and attend most alumni events, and we'll still treat you like any other student and provide you with help, but we won't be comfortable putting that "GA Seal of Approval" on you. This is in order to protect our brand, and to benefit those who do meet the standards.

Our philosophy is that being a good programmer is much more than writing good code. There's no "bell curve" or number of students we have to give a "C" to. We're just asking you to be on-time and make an effort.

### Attendance

You'll be taking your own attendance every morning. We have a system set up on Garnet that tracks the IP address from which you take attendance -- so we can tell if you're not actually in a classroom!

Metro delays can happen. The solution is to leave every day earlier than you think you should. The instructors are on-time every day and we live all over the area. If we can do it, so can you!

If you do arrive late, we'll ask that you not enter the classrooms until they go on break. Having folks coming in late is a huge distraction to the instructors and students, and if you come in late but can still sneak in then it's kind of a slap in the face to the students who are here on-time.

### Instructor Communication

- Instructors who are not scheduled for Evening Office Hours **may not** respond to code questions via Slack or in person, even if we're in the office.
  - **Question**: Why would we do this?
  - **Answer**: Work/Life Balance.
- Feel free to send any messages to us and we'll reach out to you the next day.
- Should you have a logistical question, you may contact the **Student Communication Manager**
  - This is Adrian.

### Student Constitution (20 minutes)

Given four prompts (Effort, Time, Collaboration, Goals), students take 7 minutes
to walk around and add their thoughts / feelings and +1 others they agree with.

Instructors take a few minutes for each prompt to discuss and synthesize the
what's been written and highlight those commonly +1'd.

## BREAK (10:30 - 10:40)

## Squad Breakouts (10:40 - 11:30)

### Get to know each other

### Q and A

## Entire Cohort Meets (11:45 - 12:30)

### GA Instructor / Staff Introductions (15 minutes)
### Producers - Administrative Info (10 minutes)
#### Refund Policy

### Student constitution (15 minutes)

Each classroom shares back the highlights from their discussions, and
compare/contrast.

### Making the most of a large cohort (5 minutes)

We'll do our best to give you the best of both worlds. You'll have the
close connections and individualized instruction of your squad (7:1 student ratio). (as well as a reasonable class size). But you'll also have a chance to meet 66 other students
with whom you can learn, teach, network, and make life-long friends.

Our advice is to try to make close friends (support network), but also to work
(pair program) with as many people as possible. One of the greatest aspects of
a program like this is that you can work with so many different people, and gain
exposure to their ways of thinking and working.

We'll often encourage you to cross-pair and provide activities to help you get
to know your fellow students.

## LUNCH BREAK (12:30 - 1:30)

## Lesson 1 (1:30 - 4:00)
